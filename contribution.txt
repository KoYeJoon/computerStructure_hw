build_Cache : I initialize the cache by nest and away.
access_Cache :
	I divided by 3 situation
	if valid==1 && tag is correct, I check by flag. Because it is case of hit. And age goes to 0.
	if valid==1 && tag is not correct, I divided 2 situation.
	One is ways are full. The other is ways are not full.
	cf)if the ways are full, and modified=1 write back++
	if valid==0 , I push the data .
	Read data get modified =0
	Write data get modified=1
	and last time, I add the age.
Main	:
	I set simCache s,E,b. And I calculate the index and tag.
	and I divided R operation and W operation.
